## Challenges Addressed

### 1. Kerykeion Availability
- **Challenge**: Kerykeion may not be available in all environments
- **Solution**: Comprehensive fallback testing with skipif decorators

### 2. Russian Localization Complexity
- **Challenge**: 6 grammatical cases × 12 signs = 72 combinations
- **Solution**: Systematic enum validation and cultural adaptation testing

### 3. Voice Interface Constraints  
- **Challenge**: Alice has strict limits (800 chars, 5 buttons, 3-5s response)
- **Solution**: Dedicated constraint validation and optimization testing

### 4. Performance Requirements
- **Challenge**: Real-time voice interface requires <5s response times
- **Solution**: Comprehensive benchmarking with statistical analysis

### 5. Astronomical Accuracy
- **Challenge**: Validating complex calculations against known data
- **Solution**: Historical figure birth charts and verified astronomical events
